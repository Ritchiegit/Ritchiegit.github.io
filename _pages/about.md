I am a second-year master student in [John Hopcroft Center](https://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Shuai Li](https://shuaili8.github.io/). Before joining SJTU, I obtained my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Technology from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2020.
